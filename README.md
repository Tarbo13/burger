## Description
This is a full stack web app that uses node.js, express and mysql to display different types of burgers that a user would like to eat. MVC file structure is used to organize the applications code.  Handlebars is used to render the HTML file and insert the sql data into the pages as the user interacts buttons and input fields.  A mysql database is created to store and retrieve the various user entries onto a table.  I used an orm to generate the various sql calls that are then used in a .js file to store, display and delete the data. 

## Installation
This application requires the following to be installed:  a `package.json` file, `mysql` npm package, `express` npm package, `pair`, and the `express-handlebars` npm package.  It is also required that a connection is created to a mysql database.

## Usage
This application can be used by deploying the site via the link below.  Once the page is deployed use the input field and buttons provided to devrour or trash burgers. Also, I've included a link to my portfolio page, which also has access to this application.
